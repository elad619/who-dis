tlsh - (name of fuzzy hash) - hash which similiar to similar files
vhash - fuzzy hash of vt (in house)

exiftool.Timestamp - exits only on windows -  only hour
exiftool.CodeSize -
exiftool.LinkerVersion -
#names - names of files
# capabilities_tags - (categorical check in vt capabilities_tags) - need to find a list of all the capabilities to make it useful
total_votes - harmless and malicious
ssdeep
pe_info - contains metadata of the pe headers, including rich headers and import tables. contains a lot of information that we may wat to use. compiler_product_versions, import_list.
pe_info.resource_langs - only the key
#pe_info.import_list - maybe make fuzzy hash ourselves
#pe_info.overlay.entropy ?
pe_info.overlay.size
pe_info.overlay.compiler_product_versions (check which features)
pe_info.resource_types.(multiple types with default 0) - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/menurc/resource-types
# pe_info.sections.virtual_size of first 4 sections


#popular_threat_classification - (we better use last_analysis_stats and last_analysis_results) suggested_threat_label consists of the thread_category and threat_name, summarized data of the popular category and name, and holds a counter of the number of anti-viruses that classified the threat. (need to find the number of avs).
#popular_threat_category.value
size -
times_submitted - maybe like unique sources
reputation -
# sandbox_verdicts - list with sandbox_name and malware_classification - helps for malware/not malware analysis.
#crowdsoruced_ids_resutls - contains a json of snort rules (network based rules) that jumps on the executable - intersting metdata - number of rules, rule_msg, rule_category, alert_context: list of (hostname, dest_port, url)
unique_sources - mostly for publicity of the malware in the wild.
first_submission_date  -
last_analysis_stats.harmless
last_analysis_stats.type-unsupported
last_analysis_stats.suspicious
last_analysis_stats.confirmed-timeout
last_analysis_stats.timeout
last_analysis_stats.failure
last_analysis_stats.malicious
last_analysis_stats.undetected
#last_analysis_stats - like popular_threat_classification but better - av statuses/categories count
#last_analysis_results - the av results themselves - like popular_threat_classification better, compare vectors of anti-viruses by category (malicious or not)
#crowedsourced_yara_results - use the names to calculate the distance between strings
#meaningful_name - if is equal to known one it is interesting


To calculate:
    tooltester - difference between exiftool.Timestamp and first_submission_date
